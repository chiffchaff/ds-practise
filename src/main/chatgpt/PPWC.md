It significantly benefits financial institution customers who authorize the use of their customer data[3].

> APR vs. APY: What's the Difference?

APR (Annual Percentage Rate) and APY (Annual Percentage Yield) are both financial terms used to represent the interest paid on a loan or earned on a deposit account. Although both APR and APY are expressed as percentages, they are calculated differently and serve different purposes.

**APR**
- **APR** represents the annual interest rate charged by a lender or financial institution on a loan or credit card. It includes the interest rate as well as any fees or charges associated with the loan or credit card. APR is calculated using a simple interest formula, which means that interest is only calculated on the principal amount of the loan.
  
- The basic formula to calculate APR is:
```
Simple Interest

APR = ((Fees + Interest/Principal)/n) x 365 x 100
n = number of days in the loan term
```

**APY**
- **APY** represents the total amount of interest earned on a deposit account, such as a savings account or certificate of deposit (CD), over the course of a year. APY takes into account the effect of compounding interest, which means that interest is calculated not only on the principal amount of the account, but also on any interest that has already been earned.
- The basic formula to calculate APY is:
```
APY = (1 + r/n)n – 1
```

> how does  Mastercard/Visa authorization settlements work

Mastercard/Visa authorization settlements are the processes involved in processing electronic transactions made using Mastercard or Visa credit/debit cards. The process can be divided into three stages: authorization, clearing, and settlement.

1. Authorization:
   During this stage, the cardholder initiates a transaction by presenting their card to the merchant. The merchant then sends an authorization request to the acquiring bank (the bank that processes payments for the merchant). The acquiring bank sends the authorization request to the cardholder's issuing bank (the bank that issued the card to the cardholder) to check whether the cardholder has sufficient funds or credit to complete the transaction. The issuing bank then approves or declines the transaction and sends a response to the acquiring bank. The acquiring bank then sends the response to the merchant, who can either complete or decline the transaction.
2. Clearing:
   During this stage, the merchant submits all approved transactions to their acquiring bank. The acquiring bank then sends the transactions to the card associations (e.g., Mastercard or Visa) for processing. The card associations verify the transactions and transfer the funds to the issuing banks.
3. Settlement:
   During this stage, the issuing banks transfer the funds to the acquiring banks, which then deposit the funds into the merchant's account. Settlement usually occurs within a few days after the transaction is completed.

The process is repeated for every transaction made using a Mastercard or Visa credit/debit card. The fees associated with the process (e.g., interchange fees) are typically paid by the merchant to the acquiring bank, which then pays the card associations and issuing banks.

Overall, Mastercard/Visa authorization settlements are complex processes that involve multiple parties, including cardholders, merchants, acquiring banks, card associations, and issuing banks. However, they are essential for enabling electronic payments using Mastercard or Visa credit/debit cards, which are widely used around the world.
