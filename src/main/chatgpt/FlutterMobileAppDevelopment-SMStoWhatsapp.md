> You are mobile app developer and expert in flutter development. Develop mobile app that can read SMS from mobile and send the new SMS messages to whatsapp number

As an AI language model, I can provide you with a general outline of how to create a mobile app that can read SMS messages and send new SMS messages to a WhatsApp number using Flutter. Please note that the following steps are only for guidance, and may require modifications based on your specific project requirements.

1.  Install and set up the Flutter development environment on your machine.
    
2.  Create a new Flutter project using the command line or IDE of your choice.
    
3.  Add the flutter\_sms package to your project by adding it as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.
    
4.  Add the necessary permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file for reading SMS messages.
    
5.  Create a new page in your Flutter app that will display a list of all the SMS messages.
    
6.  Use the flutter\_sms package to read all the SMS messages from the user's phone.
    
7.  Display the SMS messages on the page you created in step 5.
    
8.  Add a button to the page that will send a new SMS message to a WhatsApp number.
    
9.  Use the url\_launcher package to launch the WhatsApp app and send the new SMS message to the specified number.
    
10.  Test the app thoroughly to ensure that it is working as expected.
    

Here is some sample code for reading SMS messages using the flutter\_sms package:

dart

```dart
import 'package:flutter_sms/flutter_sms.dart';

List<SmsMessage> messages = await FlutterSms.listSMS(
    // filter by date, number, read status, etc.
    );
```

And here is some sample code for sending a new SMS message to a WhatsApp number using the url\_launcher package:

dart

```dart
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

final String whatsappUrl = "whatsapp://send?phone=$phoneNumber&text=$messageText";

if (await canLaunch(whatsappUrl)) {
  await launch(whatsappUrl);
} else {
  throw 'Could not launch $whatsappUrl';
}
```

Please note that the phone number should be formatted in international format with the country code, and the message text should be URL-encoded.

Sure, here's a more detailed step-by-step guide for developing a mobile app that can read SMS from a mobile device and send new SMS messages to a WhatsApp number using Flutter:

1.  Install Flutter and set up the development environment
    
    *   You can follow the official Flutter installation guide for your platform: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
    *   You will also need an IDE such as Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, or IntelliJ IDEA with the Flutter plugin installed.
2.  Create a new Flutter project
    
    *   Open your IDE and create a new Flutter project using the command palette or menu.
    *   Alternatively, you can create a new project from the command line using `flutter create project_name`.
3.  Add the flutter\_sms package to your project
    
    *   Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the following line to the dependencies section: `flutter_sms: ^0.2.3`.
4.  Add the necessary permissions for reading SMS messages
    
    *   Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file in the `android/app/src/main` directory.
    *   Add the following permissions inside the `<manifest>` tag:
    
    php
    
    ```php
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_SMS"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_SMS"/>
    ```
    
5.  Create a new page for displaying SMS messages
    
    *   Create a new Dart file named `sms_page.dart`.
    *   Add the following code to define the `SmsPage` widget:
    
    dart
    
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
    
    class SmsPage extends StatefulWidget {
      @override
      _SmsPageState createState() => _SmsPageState();
    }
    
    class _SmsPageState extends State<SmsPage> {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Scaffold(
          appBar: AppBar(
            title: Text('SMS Messages'),
          ),
          body: Container(
            child: Center(
              child: Text('SMS messages will be displayed here.'),
            ),
          ),
        );
      }
    }
    ```
    
6.  Read SMS messages using the flutter\_sms package
    
    *   Add the following code to the `_SmsPageState` class to read all SMS messages:
    
    dart
    
    ```dart
    import 'package:flutter_sms/flutter_sms.dart';
    
    List<SmsMessage> _messages = [];
    
    @override
    void initState() {
      super.initState();
      _readSmsMessages();
    }
    
    Future<void> _readSmsMessages() async {
      List<SmsMessage> messages = await FlutterSms.listSMS();
      setState(() {
        _messages = messages;
      });
    }
    ```
    
    *   Update the `SmsPage` widget's `build` method to display the messages:
    
    dart
    
    ```dart
    body: ListView.builder(
      itemCount: _messages.length,
      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
        SmsMessage message = _messages[index];
        return ListTile(
          title: Text(message.body),
          subtitle: Text(message.address),
        );
      },
    ),
    ```
    
7.  Add a button for sending new SMS messages to a WhatsApp number
    
    *   Add a new `FloatingActionButton` to the `SmsPage` widget:
    
    dart
    
    ```dart
    floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
      child: Icon(Icons.send),
      onPressed: () {
        _sendSmsMessage();
      },
    ),
    ```
    
    *   Add the following code to the `_SmsPageState` class to send a new SMS message:
    
    dart
    
    ```dart
    Future<void> _sendSmsMessage() async {
      String phoneNumber = '1234567890'; // replace with actual phone number
      String messageText = 'Hello from Flutter!'; // replace with actual message
    ```
