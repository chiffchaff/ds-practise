> Below is the response to the question "The time your faced your first failure and how u recovered ?" Response "I was good at academics since my childhood. In a majority of my exams I scored high marks . In class 9 th I faced my first failure. There was a transition in the syllabus and subjects . I firmly believed that I will do well in my tests as I had always done in previous years. When the results came out I was beyond shocked to see that I had failed in maths . This was the first time I failed in a subject. I was scared to disclose my results to my parents but more than anything else I was disappointed in myself . I was expecting my parents to be furious but instead they motivated me to do my best . Their belief in me gave me that zeal to perform better than ever. I studied with all my attention for the rest of the year . I paid more attention to maths and the topics made mistakes in last time. When the results for the annual examinations they showed all my hardwork that I dad throughout the year . I scored good in all subjects including maths. For the first time what i valued more than scores were the efforts I had put into this. That year I learnt a lesson , that just because I was always at top does not mean I will remain there if i stop doing the hardwork it requires to be there. Since then I try to do my best in everything I do . Even if i am good at something I try to learn and become better . This incident inculcated a forever learning temperament in me" rewrite this to make it look genuine and authentic

Response: My academic success started at an early age, consistently scoring high marks in exams throughout my school years. However, during my 9th grade, a transition in the syllabus and subjects brought a new challenge. Despite my confidence in my abilities, I was shocked to see that I had failed in mathematics. This was my first time facing failure in a subject and it was a difficult pill to swallow.

I was initially scared to share my results with my parents but when I did, they were incredibly supportive and motivated me to do my best. Their belief in me gave me the drive to push harder and improve. I dedicated the rest of the year to studying, putting in extra effort in mathematics, and working on the areas where I had made mistakes. The results of my hard work paid off in the annual exams, where I not only passed in mathematics but also improved in all subjects.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson that success is not permanent and requires consistent hard work. From that moment on, I made it a point to always put in my best effort in everything I do, regardless of how confident I am in my abilities. This experience has instilled a lifelong desire to learn and grow in me.

"I was always strong academically and consistently performed well in my exams throughout my early education. However, when I entered 9th grade, there was a major shift in the curriculum and subjects. Despite my confidence, I was shocked to see that I had failed in mathematics. This was a first for me, and it left me feeling disappointed and even scared to tell my parents. But their unwavering support and encouragement gave me the drive to work even harder.

I dedicated myself to studying and putting in extra effort, particularly in math. By the end of the year, my hard work paid off as I saw my improvement reflected in my exam results. I realized that just because I had always been at the top, it didn't mean I could rest on my laurels. This experience taught me the importance of continuously learning and improving, even in areas where I excel.

Since then, I've adopted a lifelong learning mindset and approach every task with a willingness to grow and better myself. This experience was a defining moment for me and shaped me into who I am today."

> Below is the response to the question "how do u manage your time during busy period ? " Response :"Time management is an important skill for every individual. Following a proper schedule made my life systematic. I can now assign time to all the tasks of the day without feeling burnt out by the end of the day . Regular breaks help me to refresh and put all my efforts into the next task. There are two time management methods that worked wonders for me. First is Eisenhower's method. By following this method I am able to prioritise my tasks into sections and put more attention to the task that is important and urgent at the moment. Second method is Parkinson's law . I always set an early deadline for every task . This helps to avoid all the last minute panic and confusion. It also gives a certain amount of time to a task as I have experienced I work better in a healthy amount of stress ." rewrite this to make it look genuine and authentic

Response: "Our school have this small program called each one teach one where the students are given a package which has set of books and practice tests to teach basic reading and writing techniques to a financially unstable child. One summer when a new house help was employed in our house and she uses to bring her small kid her name was Manaya with her to work everyday.

After that many other students were motivated to do the same and later I was informed by my jyep animator that many more students had joined " each one teach one" program.

Think about a time where you experienced failure or when you didn't meet your own expectations or the expectations of those around you, even after demonstrating great persistence. What are some of your most important learnings from the failures you have experienced? What are some of your most important learnings from the failures you have experienced?

"I've come to understand that failure is just a stepping stone towards success. During my journey, I've experienced my fair share of setbacks and missed expectations, but it's these moments that have taught me the most valuable lessons. Each time I failed, I was faced with the choice to give up or try again. It's in those moments of persistence that I learned the importance of resilience and determination. I realized that success is not just about never failing, but about learning and growing from those failures. I take each failure as an opportunity to reflect, learn, and become a better version of myself."

" Response: "improved my problem solving skills" rewrite this to make it look genuine and authentic

1 / 3

Balancing multiple priorities can be a challenge, especially when you have a full schedule like many Dev Degree students. I learned early on that it's important to manage my time effectively to ensure I'm making the most of each day. To help with this, I've developed a few strategies that have worked well for me.

One of the most important tools I use to manage my time and priorities is a task list. I write down everything I need to do each day and prioritize them based on urgency and importance. This helps me stay focused and on track, and I find it satisfying to cross things off my list as I complete them.

Another helpful resource I've used is a calendar. I schedule all of my appointments and deadlines, and use it as a visual representation of my schedule. This helps me stay organized and make sure I'm not double-booking myself.

Through this experience, I've learned that managing time and priorities requires discipline and organization. It's important to set clear goals and prioritize them in order to make the most of each day. I've also learned that it's okay to ask for help when you're feeling overwhelmed. Seeking support from friends, family, or a mentor can make all the difference in successfully balancing a busy schedule.

Taking regular breaks also helps me to recharge and tackle each task with full focus. Two methods that have helped me a lot with managing my time are the Eisenhower’s method and Parkinson’s law. By using the Eisenhower method, I prioritize my tasks into categories, focusing on what’s important and urgent.

"Balancing multiple priorities and managing my time has been a challenge throughout my academic journey. However, I have developed a few strategies that have proven to be effective in keeping me on track during busy periods. I like to start each day by creating a structured schedule, breaking down my tasks into categories of importance and urgency using the Eisenhower method. This allows me to prioritize my responsibilities and tackle the most pressing tasks first. Additionally, I follow Parkinson's law by setting early deadlines for each task, which helps me avoid last-minute stress and ensures that I have enough time to complete each task to the best of my ability. Taking regular breaks throughout the day also helps me recharge and approach each task with full focus. Overall, these time management techniques have helped me to stay organized and productive even during the busiest of times, and I believe they will be of great use to me in the Dev Degree program."
